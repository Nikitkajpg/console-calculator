# Console calculator
This calculator uses the principle of Reverse Polish notation. 

Rules: 
- fractional numbers are entered using a dot.
- operations that can be used: * / + - ^.
- can use brackets.

For example expression "(4.5 - 3.6)^2 * (-5)^3 + 101.25" in RPN will look like this:\
[4.5, 3.6, -, 2, ^, 5, ~, 3, ^, *, 101.25, +]\
So the result will be 0.0.
